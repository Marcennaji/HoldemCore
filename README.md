# HoldemCore

**üåê Language / Langue:** [English](README.md) | [Fran√ßais](README_fr.md)

**Portfolio Project: Modern C++ Architecture**

Texas Hold'em simulation engine applying modern software engineering practices: hexagonal architecture, TDD and CI/CD, SOLID principles, continuous refactoring, and cross-platform design.
The original project, created in 2011, has been substantially rewritten in 2025.

> **Portfolio Notice**: This repository is maintained as a demonstration of C++ engineering. Issues and PRs are welcome but the roadmap follows the author's priorities.

## üéØ Project Showcase

Texas Hold'em simulation engine demonstrating advanced software architecture through:

- **Hexagonal Architecture** with strict separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive test suite** ensuring reliability
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Multiple UI frameworks** supported through clean abstractions

### Key Features
- **Complex domain modeling**: poker rules, betting rounds, player range evaluation
- **AI strategy framework**: pluggable bot behaviors with statistical analysis
- **State machine design**: robust game flow management
- **Player behavior tracking** with database persistence

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.20+
- C++20 compatible compiler
- Qt 6.x (optional, only for GUI)

### Build & Test
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcennaji/HoldemCore.git
cd HoldemCore
cmake --preset debug-widgets
cmake --build build/debug-widgets
.\build\debug-widgets\tests\unit_tests.exe
.\build\debug-widgets\tests\e2e_tests.exe
```

*Qt Widgets version (coming soon: Qt Quick/QML version)*


## üîß Technical Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- **C++20** with modern language features
- **CMake** for cross-platform builds
- **GoogleTest** testing framework

**Platform Support:**
- **Qt 6** (Widgets and QML)
- **SQLite** embedded database
- **Cross-platform** standard C++


---
## Development Roadmap
- eliminate completely remaining SOLID violations in legacy code, by continuous refactoring
- Develop a Qt Quick (QML) GUI, for mobile version
- explore the possibility of plugging a machine learning-based bot AI

## üìö Dependencies & Licensing

**UI Framework (Optional):**
- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/) - Cross-platform application framework (Qt Widgets and Qt QML)
  
  *Note: The core engine is UI-agnostic. Qt is only required for the provided desktop interface. Developers can integrate any UI framework through the clean hexagonal architecture.*

**Third-Party Components (easily switched if needed):**
- [psim](https://github.com/christophschmalhofer/poker/tree/master/XPokerEval/XPokerEval.PokerSim) - Hand evaluation engine
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) - Embedded database  
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) - Testing framework

**Licensing:** MIT License - Free for commercial and personal use
