# HoldemCore

**Production-Grade C++ Architecture Showcase**  
Texas Hold'em poker simulation engine demonstrating modern software engineering practices: hexagonal architecture, dependency injection, comprehensive testing, and cross-platform design.

> **Portfolio Notice**: This repository is maintained as a demonstration of production-grade C++ engineering. Issues and PRs are welcome but the roadmap follows the author's priorities.

## üéØ Engineering Showcase

This project demonstrates **enterprise-level software engineering** through a complete poker simulation engine:

- **Hexagonal Architecture** with strict separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection** 
- **~500 automated tests on the core engine**, ensuring reliability and maintainability
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Multiple UI frameworks** supported through clean abstractions
- **Continuous refactoring** - ongoing modernization and architectural improvements

### Technical Complexity
- **Complex domain modeling**: poker rules, betting rounds, players'ranges re-evaluation at each action
- **AI strategy framework**: pluggable bot behaviors with range estimation
- **State machine design**: robust game flow management
- **Statistical analysis**: player behavior tracking and persistence

---
## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.20+
- C++20 compatible compiler
- Qt 6.x (optional, only for GUI)

### Build & Test the core engine (unit tests + end-to-end tests)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcennaji/HoldemCore.git
cd HoldemCore
cmake --preset debug-widgets
cmake --build build/debug-widgets
.\build\debug-widgets\tests\unit_tests.exe
.\build\debug-widgets\tests\e2e_tests.exe
```

## üè† Architecture Overview

### Core Engineering Principles

**1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**

![Hexagonal Architecture Diagram](doc/architecture.png)

*Hexagonal architecture with dependency injection - visual representation of component interactions and service flow*

**2. Dependency Injection Container**
- Testable service boundaries  
- Configurable service implementations
- Mock-friendly architecture

**3. Domain-Rich Architecture**
- Rich domain models (Player, Hand, Board, Strategy)
- Complex business logic encapsulation
- Event-driven communication via function callbacks
- Clear separation between domain and infrastructure

### 4. **Strategy Pattern Implementation**

Demonstrates **advanced OOP design** with pluggable AI behaviors:

```cpp
class BotStrategy {
public:
    virtual PlayerAction decidePreflop(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideFlop(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideTurn(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideRiver(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
};

// Clean composition over inheritance
Player player(events, "BotName");
player.setStrategy(std::make_unique<TightAggressiveStrategy>());
```

**Engineering Benefits:**
- **Runtime strategy switching** based on game conditions
- **Isolated unit testing** of individual strategies  
- **Plugin architecture** for easy strategy development
- **Template method pattern** with shared base logic

### 5. **Advanced Game Logic**
- **Range estimation algorithms** for opponent modeling
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for equity calculations  
- **Statistical analysis** with persistent player profiles
- **Complex state management** across betting rounds
- **Statistics persistence and range pruning**
- **FSM for betting rounds**: Preflop ‚Üí Flop ‚Üí Turn ‚Üí River ‚Üí PostRiver

### 6. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
- **~500 automated tests on the core engine** (unit + integration + end-to-end)
- **TDD approach** with GoogleTest framework
- **Architecture compliance tests** validating hexagonal principles
- **Mock services** for isolated component testing
- **Event-driven testing** with MockUI validation
