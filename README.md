# PokerTraining

**PokerTraining** is a Texas Hold'em No Limit training software designed to help players improve their poker skills. The project includes features such as player statistics, hand simulations, and customizable configurations.

Bots players might adjust their styles during the game, depending on the opponents behaviors.

## Features
- **Player Statistics**: Track and analyze player performance (both you and the bots).
- **Hand Simulations**: Simulate poker hands to evaluate strategies.
- **Range evaluation** : based on the previous actions in the current hand, the estimated hidden cards ranges are displayed for each player.

- **Qt GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with Qt for seamless interaction.
