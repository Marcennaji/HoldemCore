# HoldemCore

**üåê Language / Langue:** [English](README.md) | [Fran√ßais](README_fr.md)

**Portfolio Project: Modern C++ Architecture**

Texas Hold'em simulation engine applying modern software engineering practices: hexagonal architecture, TDD and CI/CD, SOLID principles, continuous refactoring, and cross-platform design.
The original project, created in 2011, has been substantially rewritten in 2025.

> **Portfolio Notice**: This repository is maintained as a demonstration of C++ engineering. Issues and PRs are welcome but the roadmap follows the author's priorities.

## üéØ Project Showcase

Texas Hold'em simulation engine demonstrating advanced software architecture through:

- **Hexagonal Architecture** with strict separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection** container pattern
- **Comprehensive test suite** ensuring reliability
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Multiple UI frameworks** supported through clean abstractions

### Key Features
- **Complex domain modeling**: poker rules, betting rounds, player range evaluation
- **AI strategy framework**: pluggable bot behaviors with statistical analysis
- **State machine design**: robust game flow management
- **Player behavior tracking** with database persistence

---
## üöÄ Quick Start

## üè† Architecture Overview

### Architecture Principles

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**

![Hexagonal Architecture Diagram](doc/architecture.png)

**Key Design Elements:**
- Dependency injection for testable boundaries
- Rich domain models with clear separation
- Event-driven communication
- Strategy pattern for pluggable AI behaviors

### 4. **Strategy Pattern Implementation**

Demonstrates **advanced OOP design** with pluggable AI behaviors:

```cpp
class BotStrategy {
public:
    virtual PlayerAction decidePreflop(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideFlop(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideTurn(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual PlayerAction decideRiver(const CurrentHandContext& ctx) = 0;
};

// Clean composition over inheritance
Player player(events, "BotName");
player.setStrategy(std::make_unique<TightAggressiveStrategy>());
```

**Benefits:**
- Runtime strategy switching
- Isolated unit testing
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

### 5. **Game Engine Features**
- **Range estimation** for opponent modeling
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for equity calculations  
- **Statistical analysis** with persistent player profiles
- **State machine** managing betting rounds (Preflop ‚Üí Flop ‚Üí Turn ‚Üí River)

### 6. **Testing Strategy**
- **Comprehensive automated testing** (unit + integration + end-to-end)
- **TDD approach** with GoogleTest framework
- **Mock services** for isolated component testing

## üìö Dependencies & Licensing

**UI Framework (Optional):**
- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/) - Cross-platform application framework (Qt Widgets and Qt QML)
  
  *Note: The core engine is UI-agnostic. Qt is only required for the provided desktop interface. Developers can integrate any UI framework through the clean hexagonal architecture.*

**Third-Party Components (easily switched if needed):**
- [psim](https://github.com/christophschmalhofer/poker/tree/master/XPokerEval/XPokerEval.PokerSim) - Hand evaluation engine
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) - Embedded database  
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) - Testing framework
