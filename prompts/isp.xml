<context>
Enforcing ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) in code design.
</context>

<goal>
Evaluate whether the core design adheres to ISP and OCP principles, providing specific examples and suggestions for improvement if necessary.
The final target is to ensure that interfaces are client-specific and that classes are not forced to implement methods they do not use.
Calls to ensureServicesInitialized should be minimized or eliminated.
</goal>

<constraints>
Focus only on design quality, not syntax.
</constraints>

<instructions>
Return a concise analysis structured as:
1. Strengths
2. Weaknesses
3. Suggested refactors (no code yet)
