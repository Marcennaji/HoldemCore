' Core Domain Relationships
Ports -[#0000FF]-> Engine : defines contracts
GameEvents -[#0000FF]-> Session : event system
Session -[#green]-> EngineFactory : uses
Session -[#green]-> PlayerFactory : creates
EngineFactory -[#green]-> Hand : creates
EngineFactory -[#green]-> Engine : creates
PlayerFactory -[#green]-> PlayerStrategy : creates

' Application Layer (Composition Root & Direct DI)
Main -[#red]-> Infra : creates concrete adapters
Main -[#red]-> GuiController : injects adapters
GuiController -[#red]-> Session : creates with injected deps
GuiController -[#red]-> EngineFactory : creates with injected deps
GuiController -[#red]-> UI : creates

' Secondary Adapters (implement core interfaces - driven by application)
ConsoleLogger -[#orange]-> Ports : implements Logger
SqliteStore -[#orange]-> Ports : implements PlayersStatisticsStore  
PsimEngine -[#orange]-> Ports : implements HandEvaluationEngine
DefaultRandomizer -[#orange]-> Ports : implements Randomizer
SqliteStore -[#orange]-> SqliteDb : uses

' Primary Adapters (drive the application - user interfaces)
UI -[#purple]-> GameEvents : subscribes to
StartWindow -[#purple]-> Session : drives application
Bridge -[#purple]-> GameEvents : handles events
Bridge -[#purple]-> TableWindow : updates UI

' Third-party Dependencies
SqliteDb -[#gray]-> SQLite3 : uses
PsimEngine -[#gray]-> psim : uses  
UI -[#gray]-> Qt6 : framework

' Constructor Dependency Injection Flow
note right of Main : Composition Root:\n• Creates concrete adapters\n• Injects via constructors\n• Pure dependency injection
note bottom of Ports : Abstract Interfaces:\n• Logger\n• HandEvaluationEngine\n• PlayersStatisticsStore\n• Randomizer
note bottom of Core : Pure Domain Logic:\n• Zero infrastructure knowledge\n• All dependencies injected\n• Constructor injection only\n• ISP compliant
note left of UI : Primary Adapters:\n• Drive the application\n• User interfaces\n• Trigger use cases
note right of Infra : Secondary Adapters:\n• Driven by application\n• Implement core interfaces\n• Infrastructure concerns
